# Cpp-Exercises
Fundamentals of C++Programming exercises as I go through each chapter. After every chapter, or every other chapter, there are a number of exercises that depend on writing C++; for each group I've made a new project file since many of the functions/classes/etc. depend on one another within each set of chapter exercises.

## There are a lot of commented-out parts
This doesn't mean they don't work, it just means that the scope of a particular question didn't involve other parts, so I would comment out the rest so that it would be easier to focus.

## A number of earlier exercises are missing
This is because they were easy enough that I just answered the question in my OneNote notebook without drafting it in VisualStudio first, once they started getting more complicated is when I would do it in an actual .cpp file and test it.
